                        <p>I’m Tahlia Stanton, a full-time artist and content creator working from a little cottage in the picturesque Hepburn Shire, Australia. Through my work, I explore the wonders of life, woven with themes of freedom, self-actualisation & authenticity.</p>
                        <h3>My highest goal is to convey the vibrancy within us. To bring light, warmth and liveliness to the world and inspire others to embrace who they are.</h3>

                    <h3>What Inspires The Artwork?</h3>
                        <p>My inspiration comes from a multitude of places; I am simply thrilled to be alive - to experience all the wonders our world has to offer and cherish the wonderful journey that is being a human being. I am deeply influenced by cinema, experiences and utilising art as a means of self-discovery.</p>
                        <p>I believe that life is an adventure and there is an abundance of inspiration all around us. I aim to offer a space for you to see yourself in the subjects I paint; these bold, authentic and spirited people who are eager to express who they are to the world.</p>

                        <h3>What Is Your Vision?</h3>
                        <p>My art career began with very humble beginnings at the age of 15, painting on the floor of my bedroom and selling pieces within minutes of uploading them to social media (I didn’t know this at the time, but selling directly to collectors was NOT the norm in the art world)!  That independence sparked such delight within my heart and is core to my vision as an artist - to bring my work to the world with transparency and honesty and in tern, pioneering a path for fellow artists to thrive, free of the limitations of the cold gallery walls.</p>
                        <p>Stepping into 2022 and beyond, my calling is to offer educational art and business courses so that they might find profitability in their creative practice and pursue their passion; so they may venture into the unknown, discover themselves fully and bring their work to the world with excitement and joy.</p>
